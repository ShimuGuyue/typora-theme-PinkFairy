This is a dividing line that elegantly divides the text into two parts, one on top,

------

and the other part is below.



This is a regular font text, plain and unremarkable. But the font I am using is New Song typeface, a very beautiful equal width font. But its only drawback is that it is too detailed, so I bolded it to better display the text.



*This is a slanted font text, with Chinese and English using 华文行楷 and Consolas respectively. This font is closer to handwriting and appears particularly elegant with the addition of italics.*



**This is a text in bold font. As regular text has already been bolded, it has not been bolded but has changed color to attract attention.**



***This is a text in italic and bold font, simply a simple combination of italic and bold.***



[This is a link font text, nothing special except for its bright colors.](https://github.com/ShimuGuyue/typora-theme-PinkFairy)



==This is a text in highlighted font, with a bright pink background and a hot pink color text that looks very eye-catching.==



~~This is a deleted text.~~~~This is a style of deleting text, usually completely covered by blue and purple, as if it has been eroded. When the mouse hovers over it, the hidden content will be fully displayed, presented in soft pink~~.



+ This is an unordered list
  + The symbols are all soft pink

1. This is a sequential table
   1. The symbol is also soft pink
   1. The inner symbol is a lowercase Roman numeral

The indentation of each layer in the list is two Chinese characters, which is four English characters.
